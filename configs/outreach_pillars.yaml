              I'm with eComplete — we acquire and scale DTC brands (Naturecan is one of ours). Always keen to connect with founders doing interesting work in the space.

      have_investors: "Great that you're funded. We're different because we're operators — our capital comes with DTC-specific growth playbooks, not just a board seat."

              Hi {{first_name}}, I've been admiring {{company_name}}'s brand. {{research_insight}}.

              I lead digital marketing at eComplete — we run performance marketing for DTC brands like Naturecan across 40 markets. Always keen to connect with fellow DTC operators.

              {{first_name}}, I ran a quick look at {{company_name}}'s digital footprint. {{research_insight}}.

              We recently helped a similar brand in {{industry}} increase their ROAS by 45% in 90 days by restructuring their ad account and fixing attribution. Happy to share the approach.

              {{first_name}}, one stat that surprises most DTC founders: brands with a proper CRO + email programme see 25-40% higher revenue per visitor.

              Most are leaving that on the table. Want me to send over our DTC Digital Health Check framework?
